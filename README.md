# Neural_Network_Vs_Matched_Filter

In this demo I compare the results of a simple neural network and a fourier space matched filter on galaxy cluster detection simulated maps of the CMB.

MatchedFilterVsNeuralNetwork.ipynb is the main notebook showing the comparison.

BasicClusterFunctions.py contains a simplified version of the cluster finding code I wrote for SPT-3G

I also use Srinivasan Raghunathan's code for making simulated maps of the CMB which can be found at https://github.com/sriniraghunathan/cmb_T_of_z
